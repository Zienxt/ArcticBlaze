# **MSC Web Development Team Upskilling Challenge**

Welcome to the **Microsoft Student Community's Web Development Upskilling Challenge!** This upskilling program is designed for beginners interested in learning web development through both **frontend** and **backend** technologies. Whether you're joining synchronously through study sessions or working asynchronously via this GitHub repository, this challenge will help you master the fundamentals of full-stack development.

## **Overview**
This program is split into two key learning tracks: 
- **Frontend Development**: Learn how to create beautiful and responsive websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Backend Development**: Build the server-side logic using Node.js, Express, and databases (SQL/NoSQL).

You will complete a series of projects to apply your learning and earn certifications for both frontend and backend development.

## **Learning Paths**
The challenge consists of both **asynchronous** and **synchronous** learning opportunities:

- **Asynchronous Learning**: Work at your own pace by completing the projects and reviewing the resources in this repository. 
- **Synchronous Learning**: Join our weekly/bi-weekly **Microsoft Teams study sessions** where we cover key concepts, live-code, and answer your questions.

## **How to Get Started**
1. **Clone this repository**:

4. **Join Study Sessions**:
If you prefer synchronous learning, join the scheduled study sessions via Microsoft Teams. The schedule and links are available in the Study Sessions folder.

5. **Complete and Submit Projects**:
Once you complete a project, submit your work via a pull request (PR) to this repository. Ensure your code follows the project guidelines.

7. **Earn Certifications**:
After completing all required projects in either frontend or backend, you will be eligible for a certification.
